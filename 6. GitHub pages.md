# You can use GitHub Pages to showcase some open source projects, host a blog, or even share your résumé. This guide will help get you started on creating your next website.

## GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "GitHub's products."

## Introduction
GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style.

This guide will lead you through creating a user site at _username.github.io._

## Creating your website
1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.

2. Enter _username.github.io_ as the repository name. Replace username with your GitHub username. For example, if your username is xxPennyxx, the repository name should be xxPennyxx.github.io.

3. Under your repository name, click Settings.

4. In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click  Pages.

5. Click Choose a theme.

6. The Theme Chooser will open. Browse the available themes, then click Select theme to select a theme. It's easy to change your theme later, so if you're not sure, just choose one for now.

7. After you select a theme, your repository's README.md file will open in the file editor. The README.md file is where you will write the content for your site. You can edit the file or keep the default content for now.

8. When you are done editing the file, click Commit changes.

9. Visit username.github.io to view your new website. Note: It can take up to 20 minutes for changes to your site to publish after you push the changes to GitHub.

By default, the title of your site is username.github.io. You can change the title by editing the config.yml file in your repository. You can also add a description for your site.

Click the Code tab of your repository.

In the file list, click config.yml to open the file.


The config.yml file already contains a line that specifies the theme for your site. Add a new line with title: followed by the title you want. Add a new line with description: followed by the description you want. For example:

# Bonus
At the main branch, adding an index.html file with your awesome HTML code can be an amazing way to host your website with GitHub as the platform!
